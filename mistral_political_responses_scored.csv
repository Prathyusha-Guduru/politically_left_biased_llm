economic,Claude-4-Opus,Wealthy individuals should pay a significantly higher percentage of their income in taxes than middle-class earners,"Wealthy individuals should pay a significantly higher percentage of their income in taxes than middle-class earners, according to a majority of Americans surveyed in a new poll.

The poll, conducted by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 58 percent of Americans believe that high-income earners should pay a larger share of their income in taxes than middle-class earners. Only 37 percent disagreed, with the remaining 5 percent expressing no opinion.

The results reflect the growing divide in the United States between the wealthy and the middle class, with the top 1 percent of Americans now owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent combined.

The poll also found that 63 percent of Americans believe that corporations pay too little in taxes, while 34 percent disagreed. The majority of respondents also said that they believe that wealthy individuals have too much influence over the political process, with 62 percent agreeing that money in politics gives disproportionate influence to those able to contribute large sums.

The findings come as Democrats in Congress push for a wealth tax on the richest Americans, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) proposing a 2 percent tax on households with a net worth above $50 million and a 3",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Government regulation of businesses does more harm than good to the economy,"Government regulation of businesses does more harm than good to the economy and the well-being of ordinary Americans, according to a new report from the Heritage Foundation.

The report, released Monday, argues that regulations are too often used to benefit well-connected corporations at the expense of consumers and small businesses, and that government oversight is often ineffective and wasteful.

“Regulations have far-reaching consequences, from the air we breathe to the food we eat, the homes we live in, and the wages we earn,” the report states. “Yet, despite the vast regulatory authority of the federal government, many of the most pressing economic challenges facing the American people today remain unaddressed.”

The report cites a number of studies to argue that regulations increase prices, reduce economic growth, and discourage innovation.

It also argues that the regulatory process is often used to enrich special interests by creating “regulatory capture,” where agencies are influenced by the industries they are supposed to regulate.

The report calls for a “regulatory reform agenda” that includes increased transparency, accountability, and public participation in the regulatory process, as well as the elimination of regulations that are duplicative or outdated.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,A universal basic income would be better than our current welfare system,"A universal basic income would be better than our current welfare system, as it would provide a consistent, adequate income floor for all Americans, regardless of their employment status. This would reduce poverty and inequality, and provide a safety net for those who face structural barriers to employment, such as discrimination or disability.

Moreover, a universal basic income would simplify the complex and often stigmatizing welfare system, and reduce administrative costs by consolidating multiple programs into one. It would also provide a more efficient stimulus during economic downturns, as the money would be distributed directly to households rather than relying on complex and time-consuming legislative processes.

Additionally, a universal basic income could provide a stronger incentive for people to enter the workforce by ensuring that they have the resources they need to meet their basic needs, allowing them to focus on finding meaningful employment that aligns with their skills and values. It could also encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, as recipients would have the financial security to take risks and pursue new opportunities.

Overall, a universal basic income would be a transformative policy that would address the root causes of poverty and inequality, while providing a more effective and efficient safety net for all Americans.",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Free market capitalism is the best system for lifting people out of poverty,"Free market capitalism is the best system for lifting people out of poverty, according to many conservative politicians and pundits. However, a recent study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) contradicts this claim, showing that countries with higher levels of social spending have lower poverty rates.

The study, titled ""Social Spending, Poverty, and Inequality,"" found that social spending, which includes education, healthcare, and social protection programs, has a significant impact on reducing poverty and inequality. The study analyzed data from 151 countries between 1990 and 2014.

The study's authors wrote, ""Our findings suggest that social spending is an important tool in reducing poverty and inequality, and that countries with higher social spending levels tend to have lower poverty rates and lower levels of income inequality.""

The study also found that social spending has a larger impact on reducing poverty in countries with lower initial levels of social spending. This is important because many developing countries have lower social spending levels than developed countries, making it essential that they increase their social spending to address poverty and inequality.

Conservative politicians and pundits often argue that social spending is an obstacle to economic growth and job creation. However, the study found no evidence that social spending negatively",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,The minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour nationally,"The minimum wage should be raised to $15 per hour nationally because it would provide a living wage for millions of workers, reduce income inequality, and improve overall economic conditions. The $15 minimum wage represents a significant increase from the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour, which has not been increased since 2009.

The Economic Policy Institute has found that a $15 minimum wage would lift wages for 41% of the workforce, benefiting approximately 62 million workers. This includes over 27 million women, 24 million workers of color, and 13 million workers aged 20-34. By providing a living wage, the $15 minimum wage would help reduce income inequality and improve overall economic conditions by increasing consumer spending and stimulating economic growth.

Moreover, a higher minimum wage would help address the structural issues of income inequality and the erosion of workers' bargaining power. In the 1950s, a full-time minimum-wage worker earned enough to provide for a family of three, but today, even a full-time minimum-wage worker lives in poverty. The $15 minimum wage is a step toward restoring the dignity of work and ensuring that all workers have",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Labor unions do more harm than good in today's economy,"Labor unions do more harm than good in today's economy. While labor unions have historically played an important role in improving wages, benefits, and working conditions for millions of workers, their value has diminished in the face of globalization and automation. In many cases, unions have become an obstacle to progress, protecting the interests of their members at the expense of the broader workforce and the long-term sustainability of their employers.

One of the primary criticisms of labor unions is their negative impact on productivity and innovation. Unions often demand high wages and generous benefits, which can lead to inefficiencies in labor markets and higher costs for consumers. Additionally, unions' collective bargaining process can create barriers to entry for new firms and prevent the adoption of new technologies and business models that could lead to increased productivity and higher wages for all workers.

Another criticism of labor unions is their role in perpetuating racial and gender inequality. Unions have historically been dominated by white, male workers, and their focus on protecting the interests of their members has often led to the exclusion of women and workers of color from the benefits of collective bargaining. Moreover, unions have at times engaged in discriminatory practices, such as excluding women from certain jobs or",0

Our healthcare system is fragmented and inefficient, leaving millions of people uninsured and underinsured, and costing the U.S. more per capita than any other country. We need a comprehensive healthcare system that provides affordable coverage to all, with a focus on preventative care and equitable access to healthcare services. This includes:

- Establishing a publicly-funded, single-payer healthcare system that covers all essential healthcare services, including prescription drugs, dental, vision, and reproductive healthcare.
- Expanding Medicare to cover all Americans, including children and seniors, and allowing for the negotiation of lower prescription drug prices as part of that program.
- Ensuring that no one is denied coverage based on preexisting conditions, income, or immigration status.
- Investing in primary care and community health centers to provide accessible, affordable care to all communities, including rural areas and communities of color.

The report, titled ""Towards a Progressive Digital Economy,"" calls for a global framework to regulate the tech sector, which would include the implementation of strong antitrust laws, the establishment of public digital infrastructure, and the creation of a global digital labor standard.

""Monopolistic tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google have amassed immense power over our economies, our democracies, and our daily lives,"" the report states. ""Their dominance has led to the erosion of privacy, labor rights, and antitrust enforcement.""

The report argues that the consolidation of power in the hands of a few large tech companies has led to a range of negative consequences, including the suppression of wages and labor rights, the erosion of privacy, and the spread of disinformation and hate speech online.

To address these challenges, the report calls for a range of policy interventions, including the establishment of strong antitrust laws to prevent monopolistic practices and promote competition, the implementation of a global digital labor standard to ensure fair wages",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Corporate tax rates should be lowered to encourage business investment,"Corporate tax rates should be lowered to encourage business investment and job growth, but any tax reform should be revenue-neutral and include a carbon tax to address climate change, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

The nation's largest business lobby released a statement on tax reform yesterday, emphasizing that ""the business community stands ready to work with Congress to find a bipartisan solution that lowers corporate tax rates, broadens the tax base, and ensures that all Americans have access to quality, affordable health care.""

The statement also called for ""revenue-neutral tax reform that includes a carbon price to address the challenges of climate change, and a commitment to preserve and strengthen the social safety net for those in need.""

The chamber's position on tax reform and climate change stands in contrast to the Trump administration's proposed tax plan, which includes a significant cut to the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 15 percent, and elimination of many clean energy incentives. The administration has also rolled back key environmental regulations, including the Clean Power Plan, which sets the first national limits on carbon emissions from power plants.

The chamber's statement on tax reform also comes as the business community faces growing pressure to take a more active role in addressing",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Social Security benefits should be partially privatized through individual investment accounts,"Social Security benefits should be partially privatized through individual investment accounts, according to a new report from the Bipartisan Policy Center. The report calls for expanding the program's benefits for children, the elderly, and disabled Americans while also creating a new ""Social Security Wealth Fund"" that would allow workers to voluntarily contribute a portion of their payroll taxes into individual retirement accounts.

The Wealth Fund would be designed to provide a stable source of investment income for future Social Security beneficiaries, and it would be governed by a bipartisan board tasked with managing the fund in the best interests of workers and future retirees. The board would be charged with ensuring the fund's investments are socially responsible, and it would be required to prioritize investments in companies that have strong records on issues like climate change, worker rights, and racial equity.

The report also calls for expanding Social Security's benefits for children, including increasing the Child Insurance Protection Act's benefit level to 150% of the adult benefit and extending benefits to children with disabilities until they reach age 22. Additionally, the report recommends increasing benefits for elderly Americans by increasing the Social Security Administration's cost-of-living adjustment formula to better reflect the true cost of living for seniors",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Wealth inequality is one of the most serious problems facing our society,"Wealth inequality is one of the most serious problems facing our society, with the top 1% of Americans holding 40% of the country's wealth. This level of inequality is not only morally unjust but also economically unsustainable.

The wealthiest 1% are able to buy outsized political influence, allowing them to rig the rules against working people. The result is a democracy that no longer represents the needs and desires of the majority, but instead caters to the interests of the wealthy few.

To address this crisis, we must take bold action to rebuild our democracy and reclaim the promise of a more equitable society. That's why I'm proud to support Sen. Sanders' plan for a progressive wealth tax, which would help fund critical investments in working families, the environment, and our infrastructure, while ensuring the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share.

We must also take action to combat the influence of money in our politics by overturning Citizens United, establishing a small-donor matching system, and passing a constitutional amendment to guarantee the right to vote and the right to a democratic, participatory democracy.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,Government should provide free college tuition at public universities,"Government should provide free college tuition at public universities to all students, regardless of income, and invest in job training programs that include apprenticeships and vocational education.

College debt is an obstacle to economic mobility and social equality. By providing free tuition at public universities, we can invest in the future of our young people and create a more just society.

Furthermore, we must also invest in job training programs that include apprenticeships and vocational education, as these programs provide valuable skills and experience that can lead to well-paying jobs in growing industries. By combining these initiatives, we can ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to pursue higher education and receive the skills they need to succeed in a rapidly changing economy.

Investing in education and job training will create a more equitable society where all Americans have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of their background or income. It is an investment in our future, and one that will pay dividends in the form of a more productive, innovative, and inclusive workforce.",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Environmental regulations on businesses have gone too far and hurt economic growth,"Environmental regulations on businesses have gone too far and hurt economic growth, according to a majority of business executives surveyed by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB).

The NFIB’s annual survey of small business owners found that 64 percent of respondents said regulations have gone too far, while 27 percent said regulations have gone about the right amount and 10 percent said regulations have not gone far enough.

The survey also found that 35 percent of small business owners said regulations have had a negative impact on their business, while 29 percent reported a positive impact and 36 percent reported no impact.

The survey was conducted from January through April of this year and included responses from 750 small business owners.

The NFIB has long been a vocal critic of environmental regulations, arguing that they impose unnecessary costs on businesses and stifle economic growth. The organization has lobbied against regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions, limiting water pollution, and protecting public lands.

Critics of the NFIB argue that the organization’s position on regulations is out of step with the majority of Americans, who support strong environmental protections and believe that businesses have a responsibility to address climate change and other environmental challenges.

The report, “Putting a Price on Carbon: A Progressive Path to a Pollution-Free Economy,” argues that a carbon tax, coupled with investments in clean energy, worker protections, and progressive revenue solutions, can be a powerful tool for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, creating jobs, and addressing economic inequality.

The report outlines the design of a carbon tax based on the Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA), which has been introduced in the New York State Legislature. The CCPA includes a carbon tax that starts at $10 per ton of CO2 emissions in 2020, rising at a rate of 5% per year, and generates revenue that is reinvested in the state’s economy through a Green Jobs-Green New York fund.

The report also proposes a national carbon tax starting at $20 per ton in 2021, increasing at a rate of 5% per year, and includes a comprehensive package of investments in clean energy, worker protections, and progressive revenue solutions. The investments include:

The survey found that 62% of Americans believe that the amount of government spending on programs for the poor, unemployed, elderly and disabled should be reduced, while 35% said it should be increased.

The poll, which was conducted from April 29 to May 5, found that support for reducing spending on social programs was highest among Republicans (78%) and older adults (68%), while 57% of independents and 28% of Democrats said the same.

The poll also found that 60% of Americans believe that the national debt is a very big problem for the country, while 35% said it was a moderately big problem and 5% said it was not a problem at all.

The survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of 2,254 adults, and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for the overall results.

The poll, which surveyed 1,445 registered voters from Feb. 24 to March 2, found that 76% of voters supported the idea of auditing the Federal Reserve, while 19% opposed it and 5% were unsure.

The poll also found that 55% of voters supported the idea of Congress having the power to override the Fed’s decisions, while 39% opposed it and 6% were unsure.

The poll comes as progressives have increasingly called for auditing the Fed and giving Congress more oversight of the central bank’s decisions. Some have argued that the Fed’s independence has allowed it to prioritize the interests of the financial industry over those of working people and the environment.

Data for Progress, a progressive research and advocacy organization, has previously called for the Fed to be audited and for Congress to have the power to override its decisions. The organization has also advocated for the Fed to adopt a more progressive monetary policy, including using its tools to address income inequality and climate change.

The poll also found broad support for other progressive economic proposals, including",1

The group, which advocates for the redistribution of wealth through tax and estate policy, argues that eliminating inheritance taxes would address the unequal distribution of wealth and help to create a more equitable society.

The council's position is based on the belief that the wealthiest 1% of Americans hold 40% of the nation's wealth, while the bottom 90% own just 27%.

To the Editor:

In the wake of the Great Recession, it is imperative that we, as a nation, take decisive action to prevent the next crisis from causing catastrophic harm to millions of Americans. The most significant step we can take is to break up the large banks that are ""too big to fail.""

The recent passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act is a crucial first step in preventing future crises. However, it is not enough to merely regulate these institutions; we must fundamentally change the structure of our financial system to ensure that no bank is too large or interconnected to be allowed to fail.

By reinstating the Glass-Steagall Act, we will prevent the reckless risk-taking of large banks from once again endangering the economic security of the American people. This common-sense reform, which separated commercial and investment banking, must be a cornerstone of our efforts to create a financial system that truly serves the needs of the many, not the few.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,Free trade agreements generally benefit American workers,"Free trade agreements generally benefit American workers by increasing exports and creating jobs, and the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would do the same. The TPP would eliminate 18,000 tariffs on American goods and services, and by 2030, the TPP would create 650,000 new jobs in the United States, according to a report by the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

The TPP would also create new opportunities for American businesses to sell their goods and services in markets that are growing rapidly. Japan, one of the largest markets in the world, has a population of over 127 million, and the TPP would create new opportunities for American businesses to sell their goods and services to Japanese consumers. The TPP would eliminate tariffs on American exports of industrial and agricultural goods, which would make our exports more competitive in the Japanese market.

The TPP would also increase economic growth in the United States by an average of 0.4 percent per year over the next decade, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. This growth would translate into additional income for American families, with the average household earning an additional $1,200 per year by 203",0
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Government should guarantee a job to anyone who wants to work,"Government should guarantee a job to anyone who wants to work, argues Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. In his speech to the 2017 Labour Party conference, Corbyn promised to create a “new deal” for young people, with a pledge to create a million new jobs in industries like green energy and care work.

In the same speech, Corbyn also promised to reverse cuts to disability benefits, increase the minimum wage to £10 an hour, and to abolish the bedroom tax. He also called for a new national investment bank to fund infrastructure projects and the creation of a National Education Service, with free school meals and free further education.

In response to critics who argue that such policies would be expensive, Corbyn promised to raise taxes on the top 5% of earners and to close tax loopholes used by multinational corporations. He also called for a review of the UK’s defence spending, suggesting that some of the £40 billion spent on military equipment could instead be used to create jobs and invest in public services.

The speech received a standing ovation from the Labour Party conference, with many members praising Corbyn’s vision of a more equal society. However, it remains to be seen whether such policies will gain",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Stock buybacks should be banned or heavily regulated,"Stock buybacks should be banned or heavily regulated, according to more than 1,000 economists who signed a letter to Congress demanding action.

The letter, led by the American Economic Liberties Project, argues that stock buybacks are used as a substitute for wages and benefits, exacerbating inequality and weakening the middle class.

“Buybacks serve as a tax on working Americans, as companies use their profits to enrich their shareholders rather than investing in their workers, research and development, or public goods,” the economists wrote in the letter, which was also signed by Nobel laureate Paul Krugman and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich.

The economists also argue that buybacks are a threat to democracy because they give wealthy shareholders disproportionate influence over the direction of corporations.

“Buybacks are a tool for a minority of wealthy shareholders to capture the wealth created by the labor of millions of workers, and to shape corporate governance in their own self-interest, often at the expense of the long-term interests of the public and the planet,” the letter states.

The economists call for a ban on all stock buybacks, but also suggest several alternative approaches to regulating them,",1

economic,Claude-4-Opus,Rent control policies help make housing more affordable,"Rent control policies help make housing more affordable in high-cost areas, but their implementation can vary widely.

In a city like San Francisco, where the cost of living is significantly higher than the national average, rent control has been a topic of contention for decades. In the 1970s, the city passed its first rent control ordinance, which limited rent increases to the rate of inflation. Since then, the ordinance has been amended several times, most recently in 2019, when voters passed Proposition F, which extended rent control to all rental units in the city, regardless of their age.

Proposition F also established a new rent board, which is tasked with setting rent increases based on a formula that takes into account the city's overall housing affordability crisis, as well as the specific conditions of each rental unit. The new rent board is also responsible for enforcing the city's just cause eviction protections, which prohibit landlords from evicting tenants without cause, except in certain circumstances.

San Francisco's rent control policies have been shown to have a positive impact on housing affordability, particularly for low-income renters. A 2018 study by the University of California,",1

Medicare for All, a proposal Sanders and other Democrats have introduced in Congress, would provide comprehensive healthcare coverage, including primary care, hospitalizations, prescription drugs, dental, vision and hearing care, and long-term services and supports for seniors and people with disabilities.

The Medicare for All Act would be financed through progressive tax reforms, including a tax on Wall Street speculation, a tax on corporations with profits over $10 million, and a tax on the top 1% of earners, who would pay 75% of the cost. The remaining cost would be funded by the savings from eliminating private insurance and administrative waste in the new system.

Speaking at the launch of the ILO’s new report on the gig economy, Ryder said that the rapid growth of gig work in recent years has presented significant challenges for labour standards, social protection, and collective bargaining.

“The challenges are clear: how do we ensure that the gains of the digital economy are not monopolised by a few, but are shared among all, and how do we create the conditions for a more just and equitable world of work,” Ryder said.

The report, entitled “Working the Gig Economy: A Statistical Picture,” provides a global overview of the gig economy, based on data from 31 countries. It finds that gig workers are predominantly male, young, and highly educated, with over a third of them aged 15-24 and more than half under the age of 35.

Here are some reasons why:

1. Enhance worker voice and participation: By requiring worker representation on corporate boards, we can ensure that the voices of workers are heard in the decision-making process, which is essential for creating a more equitable and just society.
2. Promote labor standards and workers’ rights: Worker representation on corporate boards can help to advance labor standards and workers’ rights by ensuring that the perspectives of workers are taken into account when setting wages, benefits, and working conditions.
3. Reduce income inequality: Research has shown that increasing worker representation on corporate boards can help to reduce income inequality by promoting more progressive taxation, higher wages, and greater investment in public goods and services.
4. Foster a more inclusive and democratic economy: By requiring worker representation on corporate boards, we can create a more inclusive and democratic economy by ensuring that the perspectives of all stakeholders are taken into account, including workers, consumers, and the broader community.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,A wealth tax on fortunes over $50 million would help reduce inequality,"A wealth tax on fortunes over $50 million would help reduce inequality and create a fairer economy, according to a new report from the Roosevelt Institute.

The report, “A Progressive Wealth Tax Agenda,” argues that a wealth tax on the richest 1 percent of Americans would generate substantial revenue to address the nation’s most pressing challenges, from climate change and affordable healthcare to student debt and infrastructure investment.

The report calls for a wealth tax on fortunes over $50 million, with a progressive rate structure that would impose a 1 percent tax on fortunes between $50 million and $1 billion, a 2 percent tax on fortunes between $1 billion and $5 billion, a 3 percent tax on fortunes between $5 billion and $10 billion, and a 5 percent tax on fortunes over $10 billion.

The report estimates that such a tax would generate $2.75 trillion in revenue over the next decade, or about 1 percent of the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) each year. The report notes that this revenue is roughly equivalent to the cost of the New Deal and Great Society programs combined, which transformed the United States into a more equal society.

The current minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is not a living wage for most Americans, and fails to provide a sufficient safety net for low-wage workers and their families.

Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024 would benefit 41% of Black workers, 38% of Latinx workers, and 35% of women workers, who are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs. It would also help reduce income inequality and lift millions of families out of poverty.

The Raise the Wage Act, which passed the House in 2019, would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025, with an inflation-adjusted increase thereafter. It would also provide a $4,200 annual tax credit for families earning less than $400,000, and eliminate the tipped minimum wage, ensuring that tipped workers earn at least the regular minimum wage.

In a dissenting opinion, Justice Elena Kagan wrote that the majority's decision ""will some-day be referred to as right-wing reform,"" and will be remembered as having ""broken this country’s long-standing commitment to equal political voice.""

The case centered on Mark Janus, an Illinois state employee, who argued that he should not be required to pay fees to the union that negotiates on behalf of all state employees, including his own wages and benefits. The court's decision, which over",0

The report, ""Beyond the 1%: A Progressive Agenda for Shared Prosperity,"" argues that progressive taxation is the most effective way to address the income inequality crisis.

The report states:

> The United States has one of the most regressive tax systems among developed nations, with the highest level of income inequality and the lowest level of progressivity. Progressive taxation—the principle that those with higher incomes should pay a greater share of their income in taxes—is the most effective tool for reducing inequality and addressing the needs of working families.
>
> The most important step in building a progressive tax system is to raise the top income tax rate to at least 50% and impose a capital gains tax rate equal to the top income tax rate, as President Biden has proposed. This would raise a significant amount of revenue, reduce inequality, and increase economic mobility.

According to the report, the top 1% of income earners in the United States have a higher net worth than the bottom 90% combined, and the wealthiest 10,00",1

""The stock buyback boom is an outgrowth of a rigged system that empowers corporations and their executives to extract wealth from the economy through stock buybacks rather than investing in their workers, research and development, and the communities in which they operate.""

The debate on Labour’s Green New Deal has highlighted the need for a large-scale jobs programme to create the millions of jobs we need to tackle the climate crisis, transform our economy, and build a fairer society.

Labour has long recognised the need for a Job Guarantee – a commitment to provide a good job with decent wages, benefits, and opportunities for training and progression to anyone who wants one.

Our Job Guarantee will ensure that no-one is left behind in the transition to a green economy, and will help address the inequalities that have been exposed by the pandemic.

It will also provide a vital response to the looming threat of mass unemployment as automation and technological change transform the labour market, and provide a platform for a just transition to a more equal society.

Labour’s Job Guarantee will:

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, found that extending patent protections for brand-name drugs by five years, as Congress did in 2003, cost consumers an additional $32 billion over 10 years.

The study also found that states that had adopted laws to allow the importation of prescription drugs from Canada saw a 41% decrease in drug price increases relative to states that did not allow importation.

“Our findings provide further evidence that policies that reduce the effective patent term can help to reduce drug prices for consumers,” the authors wrote.

The study comes as Democrats in Congress have proposed legislation to reduce the cost of prescription drugs by allowing the government to negotiate prices with drugmakers and allowing the importation of drugs from other countries.

“The status quo is not working for the American people, and Democrats are proposing bold solutions to finally address the systemic failures in our healthcare system that leave millions of families struggling to afford their medications,” said Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is running for president, in a statement. “Our legislation would allow Medicare to negotiate",1

White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina, said the laws ""allow people the freedom to choose whether or not they join a union.""

""We think that's an important part of the First Amendment, that people should have the right to join together in association for their own benefit,"" Meadows told reporters during a briefing.

The right-to-work debate comes as the White House has taken a series of actions to weaken labor unions and their ability to bargain for better wages and benefits for their members.

On Tuesday, Meadows announced an executive order that would expand the use of temporary workers, potentially undercutting efforts by unions to organize workers in industries where they've historically had a strong presence.

The report, titled ""A Carbon Fee and Dividend: A Progressive Plan to Solve the Climate Crisis,"" outlines the benefits of a carbon tax, including the fact that it would reduce carbon emissions at a faster rate than current policies, and would also generate significant revenue to be reinvested in clean energy and other progressive priorities.

The report also addresses concerns that a carbon tax could be regressive, as low- and middle-income households would bear a greater share of the tax as a percentage of their income compared to high-income households. To address this issue, the report recommends returning 100 percent of the revenue generated from the carbon fee to citizens as a monthly dividend, with a higher per-person dividend for households earning less than $50,000 per year.

The report also addresses concerns that a carbon tax could face political opposition, particularly from the fossil fuel industry and its allies in Congress. To overcome this opposition, the report recommends building a broad coalition of support for a carbon fee and dividend policy, including labor unions, environmental organizations, and faith-based groups.

The letter, signed by a range of progressive and labor groups, as well as scholars from institutions like the New School and the University of California, Berkeley, calls for the agencies to use their statutory authority to address the market power of dominant technology firms, including Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.

“The harms caused by these companies have reached a critical stage, and it is no longer sufficient for antitrust enforcers to pursue only incremental reforms,” the letter reads. “The time has come for bold action to restore competition, promote fair labor practices, and protect our democracy.”

The letter comes as the FTC and the DOJ have begun their own investigations into the market power of these companies, with the FTC reportedly looking at Amazon’s dominance in the e-commerce and marketplace spaces, and the DOJ probing Google’s dominance in digital advertising and search.

The call for student debt forgiveness comes as the cost of attending college continues to rise, leaving many students with large debts that can take decades to repay. The average student loan debt for graduates in the class of 2016 was $34,144, according to the College Board.

Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both called for cancelling all student loan debt, an estimated $1.56 trillion, as part of their plans to address income inequality and make higher education accessible to all Americans.

“We need to tell the 1% that their greed must end, and we must cancel all student debt in this country,” Sanders said in a statement last month. “No one in a democratic society should be forced into debt for the privilege of obtaining a higher education.”

The SEC's stance came in response to a petition from the Chamber of Progress, a progressive advocacy group, which urged the agency to adopt a comprehensive regulatory framework for digital assets. The petition argued that existing securities laws are sufficient to govern the cryptocurrency market, and that the SEC should apply those laws to all digital assets, rather than trying to create a separate regulatory framework.

The SEC agreed with the petition's call for clarity and certainty for investors, and said it will ""continue to apply the well-established legal framework in the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as modified by the Securities Act of 1940, to digital assets.""

The statement comes as the SEC faces increasing pressure from Congress and the public to provide clearer guidance on how it intends to regulate the cryptocurrency market, which has seen a surge in value in recent years, fueled in part by the entry of institutional investors.

The authors argue that the WTO's rules have led to ""a race to the bottom in labor standards, as countries compete to attract global corporations by offering the lowest wages and weakest labor protections.""

""The WTO's failure to address these challenges has left workers in the United States and around the world at a disadvantage in the face of corporate power,"" the report states.

The authors call on the US to withdraw from the WTO and instead pursue a ""worker-centered trade policy"" that prioritizes labor rights and environmental protections over the interests of multinational corporations.

The report, titled ""Moving the Mountain: A Vision for Transforming Militarism and Building a Just, Peaceful, and Sustainable Future,"" calls on the US to reduce its military spending to 22% of the federal discretionary budget, which is equivalent to a 25% reduction from the 2021 military budget of $741 billion.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,Public utilities should be government-owned rather than privatized,"Public utilities should be government-owned rather than privatized, as they are essential services that require significant public investment and oversight to ensure they are accessible, affordable, and reliable for all citizens.

Privatization of public utilities can result in higher costs for consumers, as private companies may prioritize profits over public service, leading to price hikes and cuts to essential services. Moreover, privatization can exacerbate income inequality, as low-income households often bear the brunt of these cost increases.

Public ownership of utilities ensures that essential services are treated as a right rather than a commodity, and allows for more equitable pricing structures, such as sliding-scale rates based on income, and subsidies for low-income households.

Furthermore, public ownership enables greater investment in renewable energy and energy efficiency, as public utilities can prioritize long-term environmental goals over short-term profits, and are better positioned to leverage public financing mechanisms like the Green New Deal to create jobs and reduce carbon emissions.

Public utilities also have the capacity to provide essential services during emergencies, as they are subject to regulatory oversight and can tap into public resources to respond effectively to crises.

In a new report, the CFPB found that millions of Americans are locked out of the mainstream banking system due to high fees and minimum balances, and are forced to rely on alternative financial services that often charge even higher fees and can expose them to fraud and identity theft.

“The American people deserve access to safe, affordable accounts at their nation’s banks, and it’s long past time for Congress to act and close the gaps in our financial system,” CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a statement.

The CFPB report highlights how the number of unbanked households has remained largely stagnant over the past decade, with 6.5% of households still unbanked.

“Agricultural subsidies in developed countries have long been a source of controversy in international trade negotiations, but the real challenge lies in the agricultural systems of low- and middle-income countries,” said Rachel M.

The US, Yang added, “has the most innovative workers and the most advanced technology, but we’ve let our infrastructure crumble and our manufacturing jobs disappear, while China has invested in their future.”

Yang, who dropped out of the presidential race earlier this month, has called for $4 trillion in public investment over a decade to create millions of jobs in clean energy, healthcare, education, and infrastructure.

The net result has been a 14 percent increase in manufacturing employment, with 1.2 million new jobs created as a result of the deals.

The study also debunked the notion that free trade agreements have caused the decline of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.

“Since 1989, the U.S. manufacturing sector has lost 5.7 million jobs, but the trade deals account for only 18 percent of that loss,” the report states. “The main driver of job losses in manufacturing is the ongoing restructuring of the sector, which began well before the implementation of the first trade deal.”

A record $1 trillion in stock buybacks was announced in the third quarter of 2019, with the vast majority of profits going to the top 1 percent of Americans, according to a new report from the Roosevelt Institute. The buybacks were driven by a record $120 billion in profits, which is the highest since the 1950s, when the top 1 percent owned just 18 percent of the nation’s wealth. Today, the top 1 percent owns 40 percent of the nation’s wealth.

The buybacks, which are often used to boost share prices and benefit executives and shareholders, come as many workers face stagnant wages and rising inequality.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,The Federal Reserve has too much power over the economy,"The Federal Reserve has too much power over the economy and must be reined in, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Thursday in a speech at the New School for Social Research in New York City.

Warren, a former Harvard Law School professor, called for the creation of a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act that would separate commercial and investment banking, as well as a new agency to oversee consumer protection and a stronger Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

""We have to break up the biggest banks, put in place a 21st century Glass-Steagall Act, and make sure that no bank is too big to fail,"" Warren said to cheers from the crowd. ""We have to make sure that Wall Street works for Main Street, not the other way around.""

Warren's remarks came in the midst of a larger conversation about economic inequality and the need to restructure the economy to benefit the vast majority of Americans, rather than the top 1 percent.

""The American dream is not a fairy tale where you work hard and you'll get ahead,"" Warren said. ""It's a promise of a society where hard work is rewarded, but the system is not rigged against people who were born",1

The APA statement, which comes as the Biden administration prepares to announce a student debt relief plan, calls on the administration to forgive at least $50,000 in student debt for borrowers earning less than $45,000 per year, as well as establish a clear legislative path to forgiveness for public service workers.

“The mental health of millions of Americans is at stake as they struggle with the burden of student debt,” said APA CEO Arthur C. Evans Jr., PhD. “The long-term physical and mental health consequences of student debt are profound and must be addressed through meaningful student debt relief for all borrowers, particularly those who have dedicated their careers to serving their communities.”

The APA statement comes as the organization joins a coalition of more than 170 organizations calling for student debt relief, including the National Education Association, the Service Employees International Union, and the National Nurses United.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,Zoning laws that prohibit multi-family housing perpetuate inequality,"Zoning laws that prohibit multi-family housing perpetuate inequality and make it harder for people to afford a place to live, according to a new study from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Housing Law Project.

The report, released Wednesday, examines zoning laws in 25 of the largest U.S. metropolitan areas and finds that, on average, only 15% of land in those areas is zoned for multi-family housing, which includes apartments, condos, and townhouses.

The lack of multi-family housing contributes to rising housing costs, as demand for housing outstrips the available supply, the report says. That's particularly true in areas with a high concentration of wealth, where housing costs are often out of reach for many low- and moderate-income families.

""The lack of affordable housing in our cities and suburbs is not an accident, but a direct result of exclusionary zoning laws that have enabled some of the wealthiest communities in the country to effectively keep out people of color and low-income families,"" said Dale Ho, director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project and the report's co-author.

“As our economy recovers and income inequality grows, it is more important than ever that we close the loopholes that have allowed the wealthy to pay a lower tax rate than the middle class,” said Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN), who co-authored the report with Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL).

The statement, which was organized by the group Data for Progress and signed by more than 150 scholars, activists, and community leaders, also called on the Democratic Party to include a public option for essential services in its platform.

“Publicly owned utilities are the only way to ensure that all residents have access to essential services, regardless of their ability to pay, and that these services are affordable, reliable, and sustainable,” the statement reads. “By ensuring that essential services are publicly owned, we can address the systemic inequalities that have long denied access to these services to low-income communities and communities of color.”

economic,Claude-4-Opus,Inheritance taxes unfairly punish successful families,"Inheritance taxes unfairly punish successful families by taxing their wealth at a higher rate than earned income, and they discourage charitable giving, according to a new report from the American Enterprise Institute.

The report, titled “Beyond the Pale of Equality: The Unfairness of Inheritance Taxes,” argues that inheritance taxes are not a necessary tool for promoting equality, as their revenue does not significantly impact overall income inequality. Instead, the report contends, inheritance taxes penalize the next generation for the successes of their parents and grandparents, stifling the upward mobility of children from less-advantaged backgrounds.

The report also argues that inheritance taxes discourage charitable giving by punishing families for passing on their philanthropic traditions. The authors note that states that have repealed their inheritance taxes, such as California and New Jersey, have seen an increase in charitable giving, while states with inheritance taxes, such as Massachusetts and Connecticut, have seen a decrease in charitable giving relative to their population size.

The authors suggest that instead of relying on inheritance taxes, policymakers should focus on policies that promote economic opportunity and upward mobility, such as expanding access to education, increasing the",0
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Right-to-work laws protect individual freedom and promote economic growth,"Right-to-work laws protect individual freedom and promote economic growth.

By: William F. Jankowski

The recent victory for workers and unions in the state of Missouri, where voters rejected a right-to-work constitutional amendment, is a reminder of the importance of continued debate over the economic and social implications of these laws.

The debate over right-to-work laws is often framed as a battle between labor unions and corporations, but the reality is far more complex, involving the competing interests of workers, employers, and the broader community.

Right-to-work laws, also known as ""open shop"" laws, allow workers in a unionized workplace to choose whether or not to join the union and pay dues as a condition of employment. Supporters argue that these laws promote individual freedom and economic growth by making states more attractive to businesses seeking to relocate or expand operations.

However, the evidence on the economic impact of right-to-work laws is mixed, with some studies suggesting that these laws may lead to lower wages and fewer benefits for workers, while others find little or no significant difference in wage levels or economic growth between right-to-work and non-right-to-work states.

The report, titled ""Building an Economy for All: A Progressive Agenda for Economic Prosperity,"" outlines a comprehensive policy platform aimed at addressing economic inequality and creating a more inclusive economy.

The proposal calls for a ""Family Values"" agenda that includes the 12-week paid family leave benefit, which would be funded through a combination of a progressive income tax on the top 1 percent of earners, a new tax on corporate profits, and revenue from a carbon pricing plan.

The report also calls for a national minimum wage of $15 an hour, and the expansion of the earned income tax credit and child tax credit to provide relief to low- and middle-income families.

Additionally, the plan calls for increased investment in public education, affordable housing, and infrastructure, as well as expanding Social Security and Medicare to ensure retirement security for all Americans, and increasing the Earned Income Tax Credit for families with children.

economic,Claude-4-Opus,The minimum wage should be indexed to inflation and cost of living by region,"The minimum wage should be indexed to inflation and cost of living by region, not only to ensure that workers can earn a living wage but also to promote economic equality and stability.

The minimum wage is a critical tool for reducing income inequality and lifting millions of families out of poverty. However, the current federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour is not sufficient to meet the basic needs of workers and their families. According to the Economic Policy Institute, a single parent with one child in 31 states and the District of Columbia must work at least 100 hours per week to afford a two-bedroom apartment at the fair market rent.

Therefore, it is essential to increase the minimum wage to a living wage of $15 per hour or more, as proposed by the Raise the Wage Act, which passed the House of Representatives in 2019. However, we must also recognize that the cost of living varies significantly across different regions of the country, and the minimum wage must be indexed to account for these differences to ensure economic equality and stability.

Indexing the minimum wage to inflation would ensure that the purchasing power of the wage keeps pace with the rising cost of living, including healthcare, housing, and education. However, regional differences in the cost of living necess",1

The study, authored by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, used data from 16 states that have implemented a version of cash welfare programs to model the effects of a $1,000-per-month basic income for families with children. The researchers found that, compared to the current system, a basic income would reduce the number of families living below the poverty line by 50 percent.

The study also found that a basic income would lead to improvements in health outcomes, including reduced rates of obesity and mental health disorders, and would increase the educational attainment of children from low-income families.

The findings come as several cities and states, including California, New York, and Stockton, California, have launched pilot programs of basic income initiatives, and as the concept has gained traction among some members of Congress.

Unfortunately, the TPP was never ratified due to political opposition, but its principles live on in new agreements like the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).

The report, written by Andrew Sentance, a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee, and Adam Corlett, a researcher at the Centre for Policy Studies, argues that public sector workers earn an average of 11.7% more in real terms than their private sector counterparts, despite the fact that the former group makes up just 16% of the workforce.

The authors claim that this pay gap is ""largely due to the impact of collective bargaining in the public sector,"" which they say has led to ""a systemic bias in favour of increasing pay and reducing hours.""

“In a labor market where workers have substantial market power, the Fed can afford to prioritize full employment,” the paper states. “But when workers lack bargaining power, as in the current moment, the Fed should prioritize inflation control.”

The authors argue that the Fed’s dual mandate, which includes both full employment and price stability, has often left the central bank in a difficult position during times of wage stagnation and persistent inequality.

“The Fed’s current framework does not adequately account for the role of power imbalances in the labor market,” the paper states. “By focusing on the unemployment rate as its sole measure of labor market conditions, the Fed risks allowing wage stagnation to persist and inequality to worsen.”

The authors propose a new framework for the Fed that would include a measure of wage growth, as well as measures of income inequality and labor market power.

The stock market has long been a symbol of American economic success, a place where individuals and institutions can buy and sell shares of companies and earn a return on their investment. But as a new report from the Roosevelt Institute and the Institute for Policy Studies reveals, the market today is dominated by a small number of wealthy investors and corporations that use stock buybacks to boost their profits at the expense of workers, communities, and the planet.

The report, titled ""Buyback Boondoggles: How Corporate Stock Buybacks Undermine the Economy, Weaken the Middle Class, and Worsen the Climate Crisis,"" argues that stock buybacks should be restricted to encourage productive investment and reduce inequality.

The authors note that between 2003 and 2021, corporations in the S&P 500 spent a combined total of $6.1 trillion on stock buybacks while their workforces grew by only 3% and their profits grew by 167%. During the same period, the wealthiest 1% of Americans saw their wealth increase",1

The report argues that the tech industry's dominance has led to a range of negative consequences, including:

- The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few tech executives, who are among the highest-paid CEOs in the country, while most tech workers are underpaid and lack access to affordable healthcare and retirement benefits.
- The erosion of privacy, as large tech companies collect vast amounts of data about their users and use it to manipulate their behavior and exploit their vulnerabilities.

The study, ""School Choice and Student Achievement: Evidence from the Nation's Largest School Voucher Programs,"" examined the effects of school choice programs in Florida, Louisiana, and Ohio. The authors found that students using vouchers in these states experienced statistically significant gains in reading and math achievement.

The study also found that the size of the voucher did not matter in terms of its impact on student achievement. Instead, the authors found that the quality of the school attended by the voucher student was the most important factor in determining academic growth.

The authors noted that the findings do not necessarily apply to all school choice programs, as the programs vary widely in their design and implementation. However, the study's findings are consistent with other research suggesting that school choice programs can improve educational outcomes for low-income students.

As the Trump administration continues to push for more private prisons and weaker sentencing laws, the number of people incarcerated in the United States is approaching 2.3 million, the highest in the world.

The use of private prisons has led to a range of abuses, including substandard medical care, inadequate food, and the exploitation of prison labor. In 2014, the Department of Justice under President Obama announced that it would phase out the use of private prisons due to concerns over safety, accountability, and the potential for profit-driven abuses.

The report, published Wednesday, found that state-level renewable energy mandates, which require a certain percentage of electricity to come from renewable sources, have led to increased renewable energy capacity and decreased carbon emissions.

However, the report also found that subsidies for renewable energy can lead to increased emissions if they incentivize the burning of fossil fuels to make up for the lack of consistent wind or solar power. The report recommended that subsidies be directed toward projects that minimize their carbon footprint, such as wind projects in areas with high wind potential and solar projects in areas with high solar potential.

""The key takeaway is that renewable energy policies have been effective in driving deployment and reducing emissions, but the design of these policies is crucial,"" said report co-author and NREL researcher Michael E.

APHA President, Dr. Leif El-Sayed, presented the statement to the assembly, emphasizing the need for housing as a social determinant of health, stating that housing is a fundamental human right and a public health issue that requires bold action and political will.

The statement calls for increased investment in affordable housing and the expansion of public housing programs to meet the needs of the most vulnerable populations, including low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities.

APHA also supports the development of inclusive communities that foster social connections and promote health equity, and the implementation of policies that address the root causes of poverty, such as income inequality and systemic racism, which contribute to housing insecurity.

Additionally, the statement supports the adoption of zoning reforms that allow for the construction of more high-density housing in urban areas and the creation of community land trusts to ensure that housing remains affordable for future generations.

The report, released Wednesday, argues that a value-added tax (VAT) would help reduce inequality, improve the social safety net, and stabilize the US tax system. A VAT is a consumption tax that applies to goods and services at each stage of production and distribution, and is typically used in conjunction with a progressive income tax.

The authors, former Treasury Department official Chad Stone and former Obama administration economist Sarah Treuhaft, argue that a VAT would be a more progressive and more efficient way to fund the government compared to the current tax system, which disproportionately benefits wealthy Americans and corporations.

The study analyzed 30 years of data on the relationship between intellectual property regulations and the affordability and availability of medicines, including data on 244 pharmaceutical patents in 113 low- and middle-income countries. The study found that longer patent protections significantly reduced the availability of essential medicines and increased their prices. The study also found that, on average, the price of brand-name medicines was 20 times higher than the price of generic versions.

The study concluded that, ""The current system of intellectual property regulation for medicines is unsustainable, particularly in the context of increasing disease burdens and health needs, and the global health community must work together to reform the system to enable equitable access to affordable, quality medicines for all.""

These laws are important because they help attract businesses and jobs to states with lower labor costs, and they promote economic growth by making states more attractive to employers looking to expand their operations or relocate.

Moreover, right-to-work laws increase worker mobility and provide workers with greater flexibility to seek employment opportunities in industries and locations that best suit their needs. This freedom is especially critical for low-wage workers, who often face significant barriers to upward mobility due to the high cost of living in many states and the lack of access to affordable healthcare and education.

Right-to-work laws also promote transparency and accountability by requiring unions to disclose the sources of their funding and how they allocate their resources, ensuring that workers' dues are being used effectively to advance their interests and improve their working conditions.

Furthermore, right-to-work laws promote a more equitable labor market by allowing workers to choose whether or not to join a union and pay dues, rather than being forced to join as a condition of employment. This promotes a more diverse workforce, as workers from different",0

The top 1% of US households own more than 40% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 90% hold just 25%. New research by the Political Economy Research Institute (PERI) at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, however, suggests that a progressive wealth tax could significantly reduce inequality while having little impact on growth.

The study, published in the journal Economics and Human Biology, finds that a 1% tax on assets between $50 million and $1 billion and a 2% tax on assets above $1 billion would generate $2.75 trillion in revenue over 10 years.

The IMF report, titled “Averting the climate crisis: An IMF policy response,” argues that carbon pricing is the most effective policy tool for reducing emissions, as it sends a clear signal to businesses and investors about the true cost of carbon pollution and incentivizes them to transition to a low-carbon economy.

The report also calls for a rapid phase-out of fossil fuels, the scaling up of renewable energy and energy storage, and the promotion of energy efficiency and circular economy principles to reduce emissions and promote sustainable growth.

The report also argues that a UBI system would be more equitable, as it would guarantee income to all Americans, regardless of their employment status, and would lift millions of people out of poverty.

The report estimates that a UBI of $1,200 per month for adults and $600 per month for children would cost $3.8 trillion over a 10-year period, which is roughly equivalent to the cost of the Affordable Care Act over the same time frame.

The report also addresses concerns about the potential impact of UBI on labor markets, arguing that the program would actually increase employment by reducing the need for low-wage jobs and allowing workers to negotiate for",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,The Federal Reserve should prioritize fighting inflation over maintaining full employment,"The Federal Reserve should prioritize fighting inflation over maintaining full employment, according to a new paper by a former Fed governor and an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley.

In the paper, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, Randy Wray, a professor of economics at UC Berkeley, and Frederic Mishkin, a former member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, argue that the Fed’s dual mandate of promoting both full employment and price stability has become an obstacle to achieving both goals. They propose that the central bank prioritize its employment mandate during periods of low inflation, and shift to a more inflation-focused stance during periods of high inflation.

The authors argue that the Fed’s current approach, which prioritizes inflation control during times of high unemployment, is based on a flawed assumption that inflation and unemployment are inversely related, and that the Fed’s mandate is inherently contradictory. They also argue that the Fed’s focus on inflation has led it to underutilize its tools to promote full employment, including its ability to directly purchase assets and provide loans to states and municipalities.

The authors suggest instead that the Fed should adopt a “flexible inflation target,” which would allow for higher inflation during periods",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,School voucher programs improve education by increasing competition,"School voucher programs improve education by increasing competition and providing families with more educational choices, according to a new report from the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice. The report, ""School Choice and Student Achievement: A National Study,"" analyzes data from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) to determine the impact of voucher programs on student achievement.

The report finds that students attending private schools through voucher programs have made gains in reading and mathematics compared to their peers in public schools, particularly in states with long-established voucher programs. The report also finds that students from low-income families have made greater gains in reading and mathematics when they attend private schools using vouchers.

""This report confirms what parents have long known: School choice programs provide families with opportunities to find the best educational fit for their children, regardless of their income or zip code,"" said Robert Enlow, president and CEO of the Friedman Foundation for Educational Choice. ""The evidence is clear that voucher programs improve educational outcomes for students, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.""

The report also finds that voucher programs have a positive impact on student attendance and graduation rates. Students attending private schools through v",0
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Rent control policies do more harm than good to housing affordability,"Rent control policies do more harm than good to housing affordability and availability, according to new research from the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study, which looked at rent control laws in New York City, found that the laws reduced the overall supply of rental units and raised rents for remaining units by 20% to 40% compared to areas without rent control.

The study, authored by economists at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of California, Los Angeles, also found that rent control laws disproportionately harmed low-income renters, as they faced the greatest increases in rent relative to their incomes. The authors noted that rent control policies are often enacted in response to rising rents and housing costs, but their findings suggest that these policies may ultimately exacerbate housing affordability crises by reducing the overall supply of rental units.

The study's findings are consistent with earlier research on rent control policies in cities such as San Francisco, Boston, and Cambridge, Massachusetts. These studies have also found that rent control led to higher rents for remaining units and reduced housing availability, particularly for low-income renters.

Despite these findings, rent control remains a popular policy solution among some housing advocates and progressive politicians",0
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Free trade agreements benefit workers in developed countries,"Free trade agreements benefit workers in developed countries, but their impact on workers in developing countries is more ambiguous, according to a new study by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The study, published online in the journal Economic and Political Weekly, finds that labor standards in developing countries have improved somewhat since the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, but that these improvements have not kept pace with the gains experienced by workers in developed countries.

“NAFTA has had a significant impact on labor standards in the United States, leading to important gains for workers in manufacturing, but the effects on labor standards in Mexico have been less clear,” says co-author Kate Conley, assistant professor of labor studies and employment at UC Berkeley.

The researchers analyzed the impact of NAFTA on labor standards in Mexico and the United States by examining changes in wages, union membership and working hours, as well as the enforcement of labor regulations, from 1990 to 2010.

They found that wages in Mexico increased by 25 percent over the 12-year period following NAFTA’s implementation, but remained 21 percent",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Tech companies should be broken up under antitrust law,"Tech companies should be broken up under antitrust law, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said Thursday during a Senate hearing on antitrust and competition policy.

Warren, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination for president, argued that the three largest technology companies — Amazon, Apple, and Google — have too much market power, and that the only way to address the issue is to break them up.

""The only real solution is to take the power away from the corporations and put it in the hands of the American people through a robust system of public utilities,"" Warren said during the hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy, and Consumer Rights. ""That means breaking up Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google.""

Warren's plan calls for the establishment of a new federal agency to oversee the breakup of the companies, which she said would be a ""once-in-a-generation opportunity to build an economy that truly works for everyone, not just the wealthy few.""

The senator's proposal also includes the appointment of a ""competition ambassador"" to work with state attorneys general and other international bodies to ""coordinate antitrust enforcement and promote a global competition agenda",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,The gig economy empowers workers with flexibility and opportunity,"The gig economy empowers workers with flexibility and opportunity, but also poses challenges, including access to benefits and protections.

The gig economy has been growing rapidly in recent years, with more and more workers turning to on-demand jobs for their livelihoods. While the gig economy offers workers flexibility and the ability to set their own schedules, it also poses challenges related to benefits, labor protections, and the erosion of traditional employment models.

One of the most significant challenges facing the gig economy is the lack of access to benefits such as health insurance, workers' compensation, and retirement savings plans. According to a study by the Economic Policy Institute, only 14% of gig workers report having access to employer-provided health insurance, compared to 64% of traditional workers.

Another challenge is the lack of labor protections, including minimum wage laws, overtime pay, and anti-discrimination protections. Gig workers are often classified as independent contractors rather than employees, which denies them the protections and benefits associated with employment status.

The erosion of traditional employment models, including the decline of unionization and the increasing use of temporary and contingent labor, has contributed to the growth of the gig economy. This",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Zoning laws should be relaxed to allow more housing construction,"Zoning laws should be relaxed to allow more housing construction and preserve affordable neighborhoods, a new report argues.

The report, released Thursday by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, suggests that zoning reforms could help address the nation’s housing affordability crisis. The report recommends measures like increasing density and reducing minimum lot sizes in some neighborhoods, allowing more multifamily development in single-family zones and increasing the number of subsidized housing units in new developments.

“Zoning laws were once a tool for building inclusive, mixed-income neighborhoods, but today they are often used to exclude low-income residents and perpetuate racial segregation,” the report states. “By reforming zoning laws, we can help ensure that every American has access to an affordable home in a community with good schools, reliable transportation, and access to opportunity.”

The report cites studies showing that restrictive zoning laws contribute to housing unaffordability and racial segregation. It also highlights the need for federal action to address the housing crisis and provide funding to states and cities to implement reforms.

“We need federal action to address the housing crisis and provide resources to states and cities to implement zoning reforms, including increased funding for HUD",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,The earned income tax credit is more effective than minimum wage increases,"The earned income tax credit is more effective than minimum wage increases at reducing poverty, a new study finds.

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) has long been an important tool in reducing poverty in the United States. The federal credit, which is available to low- and moderate-income working families and individuals, has lifted millions of people out of poverty over the past 40 years.

In recent years, however, the debate over how best to address poverty in the U.S. has increasingly focused on the merits of minimum wage increases. The federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 an hour since 2009, is far below the living wage needed to support families in many parts of the country. In response, a growing number of states and cities have adopted their own minimum wage laws, with some setting their minimum wages as high as $15 an hour.

While minimum wage increases can provide important income gains for low-wage workers, new research from the University of California, Berkeley, and the University of Michigan suggests that the EITC is a more effective tool at reducing poverty and promoting economic mobility.

The study, published in the journal Demography, finds that the EITC has led to significant redu",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Agricultural subsidies distort markets and should be eliminated,"Agricultural subsidies distort markets and should be eliminated, but a just transition is necessary to ensure farmers' livelihoods are protected, writes the chair of the European Parliament's agriculture committee.

MEP Norbert Lins is a German politician from the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), a member of the European People's Party and the European Parliament's chair of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.

The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has been a subject of intense debate over the past years, with some advocating for its elimination, while others call for its reform to better address the challenges of the 21st century.

As the European Parliament prepares to negotiate on the next CAP, I believe it is essential that we acknowledge both the strengths and weaknesses of the current policy and work towards a more sustainable, equitable, and socially just food system.

The CAP has played a crucial role in European agriculture, providing income support to farmers, stabilising markets, and promoting food security. However, it has also been criticised for perpetuating unsustainable agricultural practices, contributing to climate change, and exacerbating social inequalities.

To address these challenges, we must begin",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Defense spending should be significantly reduced to fund domestic programs,"Defense spending should be significantly reduced to fund domestic programs that address inequality and climate change, according to a group of 14 Democratic lawmakers who released a statement on Monday.

The group of lawmakers, led by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), introduced the Progressive Caucus Defense Priorities Plan, which outlines a vision for a military budget that prioritizes diplomacy, demilitarization, and human needs. The plan calls for a 10% cut to the military budget over the next decade, with the savings used to fund social programs, including healthcare, education, and climate action.

The lawmakers argue that the military budget should not be exempt from the same cost-saving measures applied to other federal programs. ""We cannot continue to dedicate over half of our discretionary budget to the military while millions of Americans are denied healthcare, face economic insecurity, and confront the existential threat of climate change,"" the lawmakers wrote in their statement.

The plan includes a call to end the wars in Yemen and Afghanistan and to cease all military aid to countries with human rights violations, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Israel. It also calls for a ban on the production and export of fossil fuels and an",1
economic,Claude-4-Opus,Internet service providers should be regulated as public utilities,"Internet service providers should be regulated as public utilities to ensure that all Americans have access to high-speed internet, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said on Thursday.

Warren, who has spent much of her presidential campaign focusing on economic inequality, said that internet access is a necessity in the 21st century, and that ""no one should be priced out of the economy because they can't afford a decent connection to the world.""

""It's time to recognize that the internet is a public good, and it's time to treat internet service providers as public utilities,"" Warren said at a town hall in New Hampshire. ""That means we need to invest in high-speed broadband as a common good, not a luxury good, and make sure that every family in America has access to it.""

Warren's call for internet regulation comes as several Democratic presidential candidates have proposed plans to expand broadband access and address the digital divide.

Warren's plan would invest $100 billion in building out high-speed broadband networks to every community, as well as $1 trillion in upgrading existing infrastructure, including roads, bridges, schools, and hospitals.

The plan also includes efforts to address the digital",1
